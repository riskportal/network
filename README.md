**RISK** (Regional Inference of Significant Kinships) is a next-generation tool for biological network annotation and visualization. It integrates community detection algorithms, rigorous overrepresentation analysis, and a modular framework for diverse network types. RISK identifies biologically coherent relationships within networks and generates publication-ready visualizations, making it a useful tool for biological and interdisciplinary network analysis.

## Documentation and Tutorial

Full documentation is available at:

- **Docs:** [https://riskportal.github.io/risk-docs](https://riskportal.github.io/risk-docs)
- **Tutorial Jupyter Notebook Repository:** [https://github.com/riskportal/risk-docs](https://github.com/riskportal/risk-docs)

## Installation

RISK is compatible with Python 3.8 or later and runs on all major operating systems. To install the latest version of RISK, run:

```bash
pip install risk-network --upgrade
```

## Key Features of RISK

- **Broad Data Compatibility**: Accepts multiple network formats (Cytoscape, Cytoscape JSON, GPickle, NetworkX) and user-provided annotations formatted as term–to–gene membership tables (JSON, CSV, TSV, Excel, Python dictionaries).
- **Flexible Clustering**: Offers Louvain, Leiden, Markov Clustering, Greedy Modularity, Label Propagation, Spinglass, and Walktrap, with user-defined resolution parameters to detect both coarse and fine-grained modules.
- **Statistical Testing**: Provides permutation, hypergeometric, chi-squared, and binomial tests, balancing statistical rigor with speed.
- **High-Resolution Visualization**: Generates publication-ready figures with customizable node/edge properties, contour overlays, and export to SVG, PNG, or PDF.

## Example Usage

We applied RISK to a _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ protein–protein interaction (PPI) network (Michaelis _et al_., 2023; 3,839 proteins, 30,955 interactions). RISK identified compact, functional modules overrepresented in Gene Ontology Biological Process (GO BP) terms (Ashburner _et al_., 2000), revealing biological organization including ribosomal assembly, mitochondrial organization, and RNA polymerase activity (P < 0.0001).
